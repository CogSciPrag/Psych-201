{"text": "You are repeatedly presented with a safe option and a risky option.\nIn each round, you have to select one of the two options.\nThe safe option always leads to the same outcome (OS).\nThe risky option can lead to two possible outcomes (O1 or 02).\nYou can select the safe option by pressing Z and the risky option by pressing K.\nFollowing your selection, you observe an outcome and collect the points associated with it.\nYour goal is to maximize the amount of collected points across the entire experiment.\n\nThe safe option always results in outcome OS associated with 46.0 points.\nThe risky option either results in outcome O1 associated with 85.0 points or in outcome O2 associated with 16.0 points.
